# local-attributes-prototype

A small subset of my library `eo-config`, intended to merged into it once it has been fleshed out. Thus, uses `eo-config` as dependency.

It's used to manage objects in a project file and automate/abstract out tedious, various and misc tasks that are required for keeping a project up-to-date, as things change around it.
